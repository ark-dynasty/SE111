            <h3>Qwamae Andrades</h3>
            <p>"Mid90s" is a poignant coming-of-age film that authentically captures the essence of adolescence in the 1990s skate culture. Jonah Hill's directorial debut is both heartfelt and raw, with Sunny Suljic delivering a standout performance as Stevie. The film's cinematography and soundtrack perfectly complement its nostalgic tone, immersing viewers in the era. While it explores themes of friendship, identity, and family dynamics, it does so with a genuine sensitivity that resonates deeply. Overall, "Mid90s" is a compelling and memorable film that offers a sincere look at youth and self-discovery.</p>
