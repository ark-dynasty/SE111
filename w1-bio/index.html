        <p>My name is Qwamae Andrades, I am 21 years old and I was born in Boston, MA but grew up in the Fall River Rhode Island area. I kepy myself busy as a child by being an outdoors kid and playing sports but when I was inside I was deeply interested in learning the Operating System Windows 7 and .bat files. As I got into video games and the internet, this fixation later turn into an obbsession of pentesting and Ethical Hacking. Aynone who knows a kid with a interest of pentesting is a kid with dangrous plans in his head; This was true in Middle School and High School as I tried force bruting pass firewalls, security chrome extensions, and account limmitations and was soon known for the "tech guru" in high school. I am now taking my interests and talents into the real world; When I was younger, I was always told to "never make your passions your job" and after trying multiple careers I decided to double down on Cyber Secuirty and put my all into my passion! </p>

            <h2 id="schooling">Schooling</h2>
            <p>I graduated from Blackstone Valley Prep High School in 2022. After finishing high school, I took a gap year to reflect on my goals and consider my next steps. I then enrolled at the Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI), where I spent a semester or two exploring general education and business courses. While this experience gave me exposure to different subjects, I ultimately realized that the path I was on didn’t align with my interests or long-term goals. After stepping away from school, I entered the workforce full-time for about a year and a half. During this time, I gained valuable real-world experience and developed a stronger sense of direction for my future. It was through this period of working and self-reflection that I discovered a genuine interest in technology and digital security. That realization led me to enroll at the New England Institute of Technology, where I am currently pursuing a degree in Cybersecurity. I’m excited to be in a program that aligns with both my interests and career aspirations, and I look forward to building a career in a field that is both challenging and constantly evolving.</p>
            <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy diving into tech-related projects, especially home labbing and self-hosting servers, where I experiment with different setups and explore how systems work behind the scenes. I’m also passionate about trying out different operating systems, constantly learning more about how software environments function. When I’m not tinkering with tech, I love playing video games—some of my current favorites include CS2, Deadlock, Marvel Rivals, and Skate. I’m also a big fan of virtual reality, which blends my interest in gaming with cutting-edge technology. Outside of the digital world, I enjoy going to the movies, listening to music, and capturing car photography, combining my appreciation for cars with a creative outlet.</p>
